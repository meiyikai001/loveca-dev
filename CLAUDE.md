# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [PROJECT_PROGRESS_TODO.md](PROJECT_PROGRESS_TODO.md) first. They define the project constraints and current baseline; this file is a command and architecture quick reference.

## Architecture Overview

Monorepo implementing the Love Live card game (Loveca):

- **`src/`** - Shared game engine + self-hosted API server (TypeScript, Node.js >=22.13.0; use the pnpm version pinned in root `package.json`)
- **`client/`** - Frontend UI (React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS)
- **`src/shared/`** - Shared types imported by both (via TypeScript path aliases)
- **`android/twa/`** - Trusted Web Activity packaging notes and generated Bubblewrap Android project
- **`assets/`** - Vite public assets, including PWA icons and Digital Asset Links output

## Core Design Principles

### Immutable State

All state changes create new objects. Never mutate directly:

```typescript
// ❌ player.hand.push(card)
// ✅ const newPlayer = { ...player, hand: [...player.hand, card] }
```

### Configuration-Driven Phase Management

Phase flow is defined in `src/shared/phase-config/phase-registry.ts`, not hardcoded in PhaseManager. Adding a new phase:

1. Add enum value to `enums.ts`
2. Add config object to `phase-registry.ts` (includes display, behavior, transitions, autoActions)
3. (Optional) Add special handling in game-service.ts

### Rule Automation Boundary

- System handles core rule processing and the registered first-stage card effects
- Implemented effects are registered in `CARD_ABILITY_DEFINITIONS` and tracked in `docs/card-effect-reuse-audit/existing_module_map.md`
- Unregistered or incomplete card effects require explicit `FREE` mode for manual operations, with command validation and audit; formal online play requires the opponent's agreement to enable `FREE`
- `executeCheckTiming()` automatically corrects invalid game states

### Action Handler Pattern

Each action type has a dedicated handler in `src/application/action-handlers/`:

```typescript
registerHandler(GameActionType.PLAY_MEMBER, playMemberHandler);
registerHandler(GameActionType.SET_LIVE_CARD, setLiveCardHandler);
```

## Game-Specific Context

Based on official Love Live card game rules (see `detail_rules.md`):

- **Win condition**: 3 successful Lives in success zone
- **Player zones**: hand, mainDeck, energyDeck, memberSlots (LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT, each with optional energyBelow and memberBelow cards), energyZone, liveZone, successZone, waitingRoom, exileZone, resolutionZone, inspectionZone
- **Card types**: MEMBER, LIVE, ENERGY
- **Heart colors**: PINK, RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, PURPLE, ORANGE, GRAY (colorless; total count only), RAINBOW (wild)

### Key Game Flow

1. MULLIGAN_PHASE → 2. ACTIVE_PHASE (untap) → 3. ENERGY_PHASE (draw energy) → 4. DRAW_PHASE → 5. MAIN_PHASE (player actions) → 6. LIVE_SET_PHASE → 7. PERFORMANCE_PHASE → 8. LIVE_RESULT_PHASE → repeat

## Testing

Tests in `tests/` directory using Vitest:

- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests
- `tests/simulation/` - Game simulation tests
- `tests/performance/` - Opt-in performance benchmarks

The root Vitest coverage command enforces 80% for lines, functions, branches, and statements across its configured source scope. Higher module targets in design documents are goals, not additional configured CI gates; current CI runs tests, typechecks, and builds without collecting coverage.
